# Tube Status Project

This is a small server using the Twilio messaging service and some simple web scraping to provide daily updates on the London underground.

I wrote this to learn about rust.

## Plan Currently: 
 - [x] Replace SQL with JSON.
 - [ ] Make it into a single binary that can be run in a container easily.
 - [ ] This is a full rewrite, I think.
